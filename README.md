BACKGROUND
**********
TEvA is an approach to tracing the evolution of topics (where topics are defined as something like a cluster of frequently co-occurring words) across an online conversation.  It produces a temporal trace of topics as they evolve, merge, and split.  

Algorithmically, TEvA is a mashup of a community evolution algorithm [1] and an approach to generating weighted networks from text corpora [2].  It produces something like a TextFlow analysis of an online chat forum [3], and affords measures of topic convergence and divergence. A demonstration of its application can be found in [4], 

CODE
****
This software framework is intended as a reusable, extensible library.  It currently depends upon CFinder for the underlying clique percolation algorithm, a proprietary application available for educational use at http://cfinder.org.  In the near future, I will be switching to a faster, open-source implementation of the algorithm, described in [5] and available for download at http://sourceforge.net/p/cosparallel/wiki/Home/.

TEvA is licensed under the MIT License.  Use it however you want.  Citations are always appreciated (see [4]). :-)
